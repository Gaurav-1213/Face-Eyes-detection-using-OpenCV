# Face-Eyes-detection-using-OpenCV
# Pls note -- App2.py is final python file to run and test the code.

In this repo I have described how we can build face detection and eyes detection using OpenCV package without DeepLearning.
Here u can also add multiple Harcascade filters like smile detection or FullBody detection etc. 
For time being I have shown only two of them but u can enhance this for learning purpose. Happy Learning
